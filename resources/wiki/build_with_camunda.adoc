== Business Key

A business key is a domain-specific identifier of a process instance. Compare this to the process instance id, which is a Camunda-generated UUID.

Letâ€™s consider an example: We have a process that ships book orders and we manage our orders
in a secondary database where every order is identified by an id. Now, when we start the process
to ship the order we can link the process instance directly to the order by using the order id
as the business key.

Instead of using the business key, we can also link process instances to domain objects via
process variables.
The business key is special for two reasons:

Performance: Querying by business key is often more efficient than querying by a variable value.
For example, it does not require a join with the variables table.
Visibility: The business key is displayed prominently in applications like Camunda Cockpit.
